My name is Omer Arfan, living just on the corners of Pakistan. Just a beginner programmer; nothing much yet. IT is a steep hill, but the establishment could be substantial in the future. In the meantime, check these notes about the two projects I've been working on recently:
1)THE ROBO DIVERSION:
 Level 1:
  Player VS Larry [TEMPORARY CODENAME]
 Level 2: 
  Player VS Lawrie [TEMPORARY CODENAME]
 Level 3:
  Player VS:
  1)Rookie [WEAKEST ROBOT]
 Level 4:
  Player VS:
  1)Rookie
  2)Rookie 
  [MULTI ENEMIES, STILL IN PROGRESS]
 UPGRADE SYSTEM:
  DAMAGE: LEVEL 1 TO 11
  HEALTH: LEVEL 1 TO 11
 REWARDS SYSTEM[UNDERDEVELOPED]:
  CRATES:
   Crates are the way to progress in the game! Upon winning a battle, you unlock a crate, which can be opened immediately or saved for later. These crates contain(for the time being) coins, which are used to upgrade your gear! Crates rarity goes from Super Common(1 in 2) to Cosmic(1 in 1000000). More to come later!
 ECONOMY[UNDERDEVELOPED]:
  Coins are currently the only available resource in the game. They are used to upgrade damage and health gear.
 PLANS FOR THE FUTURE[FROM HIGHEST TO LOWEST PRIORITY]:
  New types for robots, the Rootless Jungle environment completed, a wider variety of gear(both damage and health), new currencies for upgrading as well as unlocking gear, new playable characters with unique gears and cuurencies to unlock them, expanding the crate reward system.
 It is a long list, but for the record, the last three things are not in the scope of this project for the time being.
 2)PROJECT ASTER:
 Project aster, unlike the robo diversion, is far easier to code, as it is a fairly simple game based on only hitting an asteroid in the specified place given.
 However, I plan on adding more variety in the game, like health based/hit based asteroids, asteroids with special abilities, or even asteroids which give perks/boosts for a limited time.
